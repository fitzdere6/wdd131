			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p>The purpose of Bulletproof Basics is to teach clear, simple, and practical shooter
                safety to new and developing firearm users. This site will focus on the core
                safety rules, responsible handling, range etiquette, and safe storage so that
                visitors understand how to prevent accidents and build good habits. The goal is
                to promote confidence, respect, and responsibility around firearms, not fear.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p>This site is designed for new or inexperienced shooters, adults who are thinking
                about owning a firearm, and families who want to learn and review safety basics
                together. It will also help casual range-goers who want a simple refresher on
                rules and best practices. The tone will be friendly, clear, and beginner-friendly,
                with no prior experience required.</p>
			<!-- change this -->

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p>The site will use JavaScript to add helpful, interactive safety tools. Examples
                include a safety rules checklist that lets users mark off what they have learned,
                a simple multiple-choice quiz that gives instant feedback on shooter safety, and
                a dynamic “range day checklist” that lets users check and uncheck items they need
                to bring. These interactive elements will make the site more engaging and help
                visitors remember what they learn.</p>
