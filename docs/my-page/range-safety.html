          Shooting ranges are designed to be safe and controlled environments.
          Knowing how to act, what to listen for, and how to respond to commands
          keeps everyone protected and helps you feel confident on the line.

      <h2>Core Range Safety Principles</h2>
      <p>
        While every range may have slightly different rules, the core principles
        are the same: listen to the range officer, follow posted rules, and
        always prioritize safety over speed or pride.
      </p>
      <ul class="safety-list">
        <li>Always follow the instructions of the Range Safety Officer (RSO).</li>
        <li>Only handle firearms when and where it is permitted.</li>
        <li>Keep your muzzle pointed downrange at all times.</li>
        <li>Only load when you are on the firing line and allowed to do so.</li>
        <li>Stop immediately if you are unsure or feel unsafe.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2>Common Range Commands</h2>
  <p>
    Range commands keep everyone coordinated and safe. Click on a command
    below to see what it means and how you should respond.
  </p>

  <div class="command-grid">
    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="This command tells you that it is now safe and appropriate to load your firearm. You may insert a magazine or load rounds, close the action, and prepare to shoot while still keeping the muzzle pointed safely downrange. Do not fire until told to do so."
    >
      “Load and Make Ready”
    </button>

    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="This command authorizes you to begin shooting. Fire in a controlled, safe manner while keeping your awareness on the muzzle, your target, and what is beyond it. Stop firing immediately if you hear any conflicting command such as “Cease Fire.”"
    >
      “Commence Firing” / “Fire”
    </button>

    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="Stop shooting immediately. Take your finger off the trigger, keep the firearm pointed downrange, and wait for further instructions. Do not load, unload, or move your firearm until the Range Safety Officer tells you what to do next."
    >
      “Cease Fire”
    </button>

    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="This command tells you to remove all ammunition from the firearm and prove that it is empty. Drop the magazine (if applicable), open the action, visually and physically inspect the chamber, and then present the open, empty firearm so the Range Safety Officer can verify it is clear."
    >
      “Unload and Show Clear”
    </button>

    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="When the range is cold, no one should be handling firearms. Firearms must be unloaded, actions open, and left on the bench or rack. Shooters may go downrange to set up or check targets only after the Range Safety Officer confirms the line is safe."
    >
      “Range Is Cold”
    </button>

    <button
      class="command-card"
      data-description="A hot range means firearms may be handled and fired from the firing line. Do not go downrange during a hot range. All handling must still follow the four universal rules of firearm safety."

      “Range Is Hot”

      <h2>Range Etiquette &amp; Best Practices</h2>

      <ul class="safety-list">
        <li>Arrive early so you can review posted rules before shooting.</li>
        <li>Keep conversations respectful and avoid distracting other shooters.</li>
        <li>Ask questions! RSOs would rather answer questions than fix mistakes.</li>
        <li>Clean up your area, brass, and trash before leaving if the range allows.</li>
        <li>Never be afraid to call “Cease Fire” if you see something unsafe.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember, being a good range neighbor is just as important as being a
        skilled shooter. Courtesy and safety go hand in hand.

      <h2>Ready to Practice Safe Shooting?</h2>
      <p>
        Review these commands before your next range visit and practice how you
        will respond. The more familiar you are with the language of the range,
        the more confident and calm you will feel when it matters.
