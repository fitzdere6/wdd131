        <h1>Home Storage Safety: Secure, Accessible, Responsible</h1>
        <p>
          Safe storage protects your family, your visitors, and your community.
          Responsible firearm owners control who can access their firearms and
          when. A secure home doesn’t happen by accident—it happens by design.

      <h2>Why Safe Storage Matters</h2>
      <p>
        Firearms that are left unsecured can be found by children, guests,
        or intruders. Proper storage helps prevent accidents, theft, and
        misuse—while still allowing you to access your firearm when it is
        legitimately needed.
      </p>
      <ul class="safety-list">
        <li>Reduces the risk of accidental injury or death.</li>
        <li>Prevents unauthorized access by children or visitors.</li>
        <li>Makes theft and criminal misuse less likely.</li>
        <li>Shows respect for the responsibility that comes with ownership.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section class="content-section">
      <h2>Common Secure Storage Options</h2>
      <p>
        There is no one-size-fits-all solution for safe storage. The best
        choice depends on your home, your family, and your local laws. These
        options can also be combined for layered security.
      </p>
      <ul class="safety-list">
        <li>
          <strong>Lockbox or Handgun Safe:</strong>
          Small, quick-access containers that can be opened with a code, key,
          or biometric lock. Ideal for nightstands or limited spaces.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Full-Size Gun Safe:</strong>
          Heavier safes that store multiple firearms and ammunition. Often
          bolted to the floor or wall to prevent theft.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Cable Lock or Trigger Lock:</strong>
          Simple devices that block the action or trigger. These are best used
          in combination with a locked container—not as your only protection.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Locking Cabinet or Closet:</strong>
          A lockable piece of furniture or closet that adds another layer of
          security on top of individual locks and safes.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Access Plans for Your Household</h2>
      <p>
        Safe storage is not just about hardware—it is also about clear rules.
        Everyone in your home should understand what is allowed and what is not.
      </p>
      <ul class="safety-list">
        <li>Decide who is authorized to access each firearm and how.</li>
        <li>
          Never share safe combinations or keys with anyone who should not have
          direct access.
        </li>
        <li>
          Talk with children in age-appropriate ways about what to do if they
          ever see a firearm: <strong>“Stop. Don’t touch. Leave the area. Tell
          an adult.”</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
          Revisit your storage plan after big life changes—new roommates,
          visitors, or children in the home.
        </li>
      </ul>
